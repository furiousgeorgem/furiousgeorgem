# Hi, I'm George 👋

I'm a music data operations specialist and developer who lives for the "lightbulb moment" when a messy dataset finally snaps into place. I spend most of my time at the intersection of music and code, building pipelines that turn high-volume metadata into something actually useful. My goal is always to make workflows faster, cleaner, and more accurate.

## What I Do

I specialize in **data reconciliation** at Pandora Cloudcover, using Python to find "needles in haystacks" across massive music catalogs. I'm also big on **automation**—I enjoy building tools for the "boring stuff," from browser-level scripts to real-time Slack reporting. Recently, I've been focused on **AI integration**, exploring how streaming services can solve the "Remix Trap" and other metadata challenges that standard fuzzy matching can't quite catch.

## Featured Work

### [Codes & Automation Portfolio](https://github.com/furiousgeorgem/codes-and-automation-portfolio)

A collection of production tools I've built to handle music data at scale:

- **Fuzzy Matching Engine** - High-speed track reconciliation across disparate music catalogs using multi-threaded processing and intelligent candidate blocking
- **Slack Reporting Tool** - Automated CSV comparison and delta reporting for station curation workflows
- **Procurement Automation** - Batch search tools that streamline track research and acquisition
- **API Integration Pipeline** - Two-tier validation system combining Pandora API fuzzy matching with OpenAI-powered quality control for complex metadata edge cases (implementation confidential)

## Technical Skills

**Languages & Tools:** Python, SQL  
**Python Stack:** Pandas, RapidFuzz, Requests, ThreadPoolExecutor  
**APIs & Integrations:** OpenAI API, Slack API, RESTful services  
**Data Standards:** ISRC, Music Metadata (Artist/Title/Album mapping)

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing music tech, automation, and data integrity challenges.
