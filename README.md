# Hi, I'm George 👋 

### Data Operations | Python Automation | Music Tech Enthusiast

I’m a problem solver who lives at the intersection of music and code. I enjoy taking messy, high-volume datasets and building the "pipes" and logic needed to make them useful. Whether it's automating a tedious manual task or building a custom matching engine, I’m at my best when I’m making data workflows faster and more accurate.

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On
- **Data Reconciliation:** Using Python to find "needles in haystacks" across massive music catalogs.
- **Automation:** Creating scripts that handle the "boring stuff"—from browser automation to Slack-integrated reporting.
- **AI Logic:** Exploring how LLMs can solve the "Remix Trap" and other complex metadata headaches.

### 📂 My Projects
**[Codes & Automation Portfolio](https://github.com/furiousgeorgem/Codes-and-Automation-Portfolio)**
*A collection of tools I've built to handle music data at scale:*
- **Fuzzy Matching:** A high-speed engine for syncing artist and track rosters.
- **Automated Reporting:** Real-time delta reports and stakeholder updates.
- **Procurement Tools:** Streamlining track research and acquisition workflows.
