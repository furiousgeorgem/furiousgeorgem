# Hi, I'm George 👋

I’m a data operations specialist and developer who lives for the "lightbulb moment" when a messy dataset finally snaps into place. I spend most of my time at the intersection of music and code, building the logic and pipelines that turn high-volume metadata into something actually useful. My goal is always to make workflows faster, cleaner, and more accurate.

###  What I do
I specialize in **Data Reconciliation** for Pandora Cloudcover, using Python to find "needles in haystacks" across massive music catalogs. I'm also big on Automation. I enjoy building tools for the 'boring stuff,' from browser-level scripts to real-time Slack reporting. Recently, I’ve been focused on **AI Logic**, exploring how streaming services can solve the "Remix Trap" and other metadata headaches that standard code can't quite catch.

###  Featured Work
My main project is my **[Codes & Automation Portfolio](https://github.com/furiousgeorgem/Codes-and-Automation-Portfolio)**. It’s a collection of tools I’ve built to handle music data at scale, including:
* **A high-speed Fuzzy Matching engine** for syncing disparate artist and track rosters.
* **Automated Reporting tools** that provide real-time updates to stakeholders.
* **Procurement scripts** designed to streamline track research and acquisition.

###  The Toolkit
I primarily work in **Python** (Pandas, RapidFuzz, Requests, Multi-threading) and **SQL**. I’m comfortable managing metadata standards like ISRC and Artist/Title mapping, and I'm experienced in integrating tools like the **OpenAI API**, **Slack API**, and **ChartMogul**.

###  Let's chat
I’m always down to talk music tech, automation, or data integrity.

*"I believe that good data is the foundation of the music industry—I just build the tools that keep that foundation solid."*
